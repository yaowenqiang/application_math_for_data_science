Why Learn Calculus and Functions

+ Understanding functions, including their derivatives and integrals, are fundamental to machine learning, probability, and statics.
+ Deep learning and neural networks are often trained by backpropagation and gradient descent, both of which are Calculus-driven
+ Having a grasp of numeric systems will make it easier to interpret and scrutinize models and graphs
+

# variable

In mathematics, a variable is a named placeholder for an unspecified or unknown number.


# Functions

Functions are expressions that define relationships between two or more variables

More specifically a function takes independent variables (also called domain variables or input variables), plugs them into an expression, and then result in a dependent variable(also called an output variable)


# 3d functions and Beyond

f(x,y) = 2x + 3y


# Exponential and Logarithmic Functions(指数函数和对数函数)

Euler's Number(欧拉数)

# Derivatives(导数)

A derivative tells the slop of a function, and it is useful to measure the rate of change at any point in a function.
